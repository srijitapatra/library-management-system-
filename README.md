Built a library management system for the track of all books in python and using mySQL for database.

Proposed SYSTEM -
 At present   the amount of work that  has been completed on this  system that we have proposed is  from the administrator side .
Features like:-

ADD BOOKS-
Enter the book ID,  book name , author and mark if it's available or issued by someone

VIEW BOOKS-
What all books do we already have in our library , their book name, author and availability

DELETE BOOKS- 
Remove a book from the list by entering the Book ID.

ISSUED TO STUDENT-
name of the student, book name that is issued to him and author name. 

RETURN BOOKS- Book ID that has been returned  by the student. 

MAIN
To integrate all the above features and run them together, all functions are imported and executed

DATABASE- 
To store all the data of the books we have used MY sql and in the code imported pymysql. 

CONNECTION TO DATABASE-
The functions can only become meaningful if we have stored all the data in the database. 
And make a connection of the functions to the database

TKINTER- 
For the display, in the front end , we have used gui, for depiction of front page, buttons on them and visuals.
